Revision history for Posy-Plugin-Categories
===========================================

0.64 Wed 09 February 2005
-------------------------

  * (9 Feb 2005) categories_labels config option
  	Added a new config option 'categories_labels', which enables
  one to change any of the labels for category_tree and breadcrumb to something
  other than just a "pretty" version of the category.
  	One is also able to use a 'labels' argument to the functions; but
  it defaults to the 'categories_labels' config value.

  * (20 Jan 2005) added 'hide' option
  	Can now hide categories from the breadcrumb or category tree.
  Useful for "special" entries you don't want to show all the time,
  like custom not-found pages.

0.50 Sun 16 January 2005
------------------------

  * (16 Jan 2005) no show zero counts
  	In 'category_tree', don't show counts of zero, just leave it
  blank for those; it's tidier.
